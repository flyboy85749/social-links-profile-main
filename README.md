## My process

I am starting to do these challenges as a way to keep up with my skills. First, as suggested, I completed the HTML so I had something to work with as far as Ids and classes in my CSS. Then, working with the style guide and figma files, I nailed down the details of fonts, sizes, colors, ...etc. of the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
-

### What I learned

I learned that I am very rusty with even the basics of HTML and CSS, so had to do a lot of reading docs, which isn't a bad thing at all. Along the way, I was surprised at how much I had actually recalled, especially with using git and VS Code. I will continue to do these challenges as a way to keep up with my skills, and build a nice portfolio.

### Continued development

I want to keep learning old and new skills as the challenges dictate, because it's important to me that I stay fresh with front end development so I can develop my own domain names.

### Useful resources

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - I'm all for anything that is free and is an excellent source, so FreeCodecamp is a must have for me.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Another great source for learning how to code.
